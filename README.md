# SimpleRPG-2019
Created by David Orriss III, Brandon Viorato, and Jacob Clifton.

Final project for a beginner C++ programming course I took in 2019. A very simple console RPG with turn-based combat.
Code is provided as-is; it should run from the command line or in a blank Visual Studio project.

An unfinished equipment generator class is also included; this was originally intended to be used to generate
items dropped from monsters in combat but was scrapped to ensure the project could be finished in time.
